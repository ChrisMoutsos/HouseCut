# HouseCut
Software Engineering I project for Fall 2016.


Household management app to set up a list of chores on a rotation and/or time schedule that will notify users when it is their turn to do a given chore. It will provide an easy way for roommates to do their share of chores accurately, fairly, and punctually. Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) Java, XML, and Android Development is all that is needed.
